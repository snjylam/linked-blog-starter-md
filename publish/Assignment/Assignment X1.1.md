**What are the advantages to company of selling a product?**
- The company hopes to write business on profitable terms.
- If the company has WP business, WP policyholders may share in the profits from this business.
- Thus improving retention.
- The new product will improve the range of products on offer, making it more attractive to investors.
- The new product might improve the image of the company as investment product specialist.
- The company may be trying to match the products on offer from competitors. 
- The company may be losing market share elsewhere and hope to make up for that with the new product.
- The company may be trying to break into an untapped market. 
- Market research may have highlighted a demand for such products.
- This will expand the client base, so the company may cross-sell other products to these new investors.

**What are the advantages to policyholders of such products sold?**
- The policyholders are exposed to potential capital gains.
- With protection from potential capital losses due to the guarantees.
- For investors, the return on death will not be less than the premium paid.
- The with-profits policyholders may share in the profits from this business.

<u><b>X1.1(ii)</b></u>
**What are the asset combinations for guaranteed equity product?**
- Zero coupon bond for the guaranteed maturity value plus a call option on the domestic equity index.
- Domestic equities that reproduce the index (or units in tracker fund) plus a put option on the domestic equity index.

<u><b>X1.1(iii)</b></u>
**What are the risks associated in launching the guaranteed equity product?**
**Counterparty risk**
- The contracts are backed by derivatives.
- The derivatives are likely over the counter, rather than exchange traded, due to the specific risk profile. 
- So there is no clearing house to guarantee the contract.
- So the company is at risk of counterparty default.

**Mis-selling risk**
- There is risk of investors not appreciating the risks they are taking on, and subsequently unhappy with the  payouts of the policy.
- This risk may be reduced if the policy is fully and clearly explained in the marketing literature.

**Mix of new business**
- There will be cross-subsidies between larger and smaller contracts due to mismatch between charges and expenses.
- An average premium size and distribution by size will have been assumed in the pricing assumptions. 
- There is a risk that the NB mix by size is different than assumed. 
- There is a risk that the average premium is lower than expected, leading to insufficient charges to meet expenses.
- The terms are independent of age and there is a death strain at least for early durations.
- Therefore there is a risk that the average age of investors is higher than that assumed when pricing.

**Volume of new business**
- Higher volumes of new business lead to higher new business strain. There is a risk that the solvency position is reduced to an undesirable extent due to higher than expected new business volumes.
- This may lead to administration and operational failures, if processes cannot cope with the applications.
- There may be a cap on new business volumes, however there is a still a risk of 'pipeline' cases causing the cap to be breached once the product has been closed.
- On the other hand volumes of new business may be lower than expected.
- The volumes sold may be insufficient to recoup development costs.
- If the company purchases a specific volume of derivatives from the investment bank, volumes of new business lower than expected would result in purchase of an unneeded asset or a penalty payment.
- If the price of the derivatives depends on the volume required, then low volumes might increase the unit cost of the derivative, reducing product profitability.

**Data**
- This is a new product, so the company has no direct relevant experience on which to base its pricing assumptions. It is at risk of loss due to using inappropriate assumptions.

**Mortality**
- The death benefits guaranteed to be at least the original amount allocated. Therefore there is a risk of loss from more deaths than expected at early durations, due to initial expenses not recouped.
- The risk is greater for larger policies, which have a higher allocation rate.

**Investment performance**
- If the benefit profile can be closely replicated by bonds, equities, and derivatives, the investment risk is passed down to the policyholders and the investment bank once the replicating assets have been bought.
- However, there is a period between product terms signed off and investment of the monies, where the price of the derivatives could move against the company.
- The maturity value is complex, so it is not obvious if it can be replicated using basic derivatives.
- For some combinations XYZ, the company might have to accept the investment risk or negotiate for more complex derivatives.
- There is also the risk that the interest on the non-unit component of the liabilities is lower than expected.

**Expenses**
- The terms of the contract are guaranteed so there is no scope to increase charges once contract starts.
- The company is therefore at risk that expenses turn out higher than assumed in the pricing basis.
- Higher than expected inflation will increase the above risk.
- But since the term of the contract is only 5 years, this is unlikely to be significant.
- Development costs are very uncertain, since new systems are likely to be required.

**Withdrawals**
- The surrender value is not guaranteed, so the risk of loss on withdrawal is reduced.
- However, initial expenses will cause the asset share to be below the premium paid and there might be some pressure to not pay out a surrender value much below the premiums paid.
- This would result in a loss on early withdrawals.
- Although the company could subsidise these from lower payouts in respect of later withdrawals, so that overall withdrawals are either cost-neutral, or contributing to profit.
- Since surrender terms are discretionary, the exact payouts for later withdrawals could be determined after analysing withdrawals at early durations, so there may be limited risk at later durations.

**Competition**
- There is risk of competitors launching a similar product at the same time or earlier, capturing a significant proportion of the market premium invested during the offer period.
- If the competitor's terms are more attractive, the company is unlikely to sell much business.
- Unless the company reaches its limit very quickly, leaving this product still open for investment.

**Operational risk**
- The company might have no previous experience on over-the-counter derivatives.
- This might lead to inappropriate derivative contracts being entered into or inappropriate monitoring in place.
- There is a risk of inappropriate models to price the product.
- The new systems might not be ready on time or deliver the full functionality from launch.

**What are the implications of the linking the product to a different stock index?**
**Link to European index - impact on product terms & pricing**
- If the derivatives are cheaper, it could lead to better terms to policyholders.
- This may lead to higher expected sales if Y and Z are more important relative to X.
- But if X is the key term, then potential equity growth (the values of Y and Z) may not make much difference.
- For investors, exposure to foreign stock market is more risky due to the currency risk.
- And different economic situation.
- The effect on sales will therefore depend on the target market and level of financial sophistication.
- The company would want to know the price difference between the two sets of derivatives, to see what difference it could have on the terms being offered. 
- If the difference is small, the improvement in terms is offset by the reduction in marketability as it is using a less familiar stock index.

**Link to European index - impact of index volatility**
- The company would want to know the volatility of this differential to see if it is likely to persist.
- There is a risk the situation reversed just before the company bought derivatives from the investment bank.
- If the company purchases the derivatives in advance, it will need to estimate the total sales volume, but if it gets this wrong, it will be left with unwanted exposure.
- This modification may also make it harder to predict the demand for the product and so increase the risk it will be left with unwanted exposure.
- However, if it waits until sales volumes are known, there is a risk that the price of derivatives move against the company, resulting in certain loss.

**Link to European index - alternative**
- An alternative to offering policyholders better terms would be to take the difference as additional profit for the suppliers of capital.
- This might be considered inequitable.
- Unless the risk associated with these profits was considered higher.
- Possibly due to more uncertainty over sales volumes.

<u><b>X1.1(iv)(b)</b></u>
**What are the implications of the providing guaranteed surrender value?**
- Splitting the investment into ten identical policies and allowing partial surrender improves the flexibility over when policyholders can access their money and improves the attractiveness of the product.
- Having 100 identical policies rather than 100 would improve the flexibility further.
- Partial surrenders may also have tax advantages for policyholders.
- Offering guaranteed surrender terms could improve attractiveness and sales of the product. 
- However, a fair value given to policyholders on early surrender will be closely related to the value of derivatives held by the company in respect to the contracts being surrendered. 
- The value of these will be volatile and not known in advance.
- This allows scope for anti-selective surrenders, which means policyholders are far more likely to surrender when the assets backing the contract are worth less than the surrender value.
- Since all money will be invested on the same date, the risk of a large loss on surrender would be very high.
- The suppliers of capital would demand a very high risk margin within the pricing to allow for this, making the product terms unmarketable.
- Therefore surrender terms should not be guaranteed.

<u><b>X1.1(iv)(c)</b></u>
**What are the implication of offering multiple product terms?**
- Offering a choice to potential investors might increase the attractiveness of the product and boost sales.
- However, it might put people off, if they felt unable to make an educated decision.
- Offering a choice would cater to those who want a high guaranteed return (high X).
- Offering a choice would cater to those who want more exposure to the stock market (high Y, low Z).
- Offering a choice would cater to those who want highly geared equity exposure (very high Y).
- However, the company might decide that its purpose is not to provide a highly geared exposure and that such options are not consistent with the philosophy behind its existing product range.
- The risk being accepted by policyholders could be limited by narrowing the range available for X, Y, Z.
- Or by offering just two or three set combinations, which the company would choose after careful market research.
- The company should investigate the extent of choice available from other companies in the market.
- Offering a choice will add complexity to the required systems and the new business administration process.
- There is a risk that policyholders would not fully understand the implications for risk of each of the available options.
- So the company should ensure the risks are fully explained in its marketing literature.
- If there is more than one product version, people will be able to compare the returns from each retrospectively.
- With hindsight, everyone will be able to see what the best option was, and they are likely to feel that they have received poor value for money if they chose a different option.
- Whilst not a fair reflection of the company’s performance, it might hinder future sales to these same policyholders.
- Each option will require a different set of derivatives, so it will be important to estimate sales volumes split down by the various options.
- This will obviously be much harder than if there were just one version. 
- If a smaller amount of each type of derivative is required, the investment bank might charge more per unit, making the product more expensive.

<u><b>X1.1(iv)(d)</b></u>
**What are the implications of the extending offer period?**
- The company is likely to place a cap on new business written due to new business strain and product risks.
- If it expects to achieve the cap within one month offer period, there is no need to extend it to two months.
- However, if not the case, a longer offer period might increase sales.
- The relatively high rate of interest compared to current cash returns may also be attractive.
- However, its cost will need to be priced for.
- If no interest is given during this period, investors are likely to wait until the end of period before committing themselves, making final sales volumes harder to predict.
- Specifying in advance the fixed rate of interest to give is a source of risk, particularly at a level which is above short-term interest rates.
- To reduce this risk, a lower rate could be offered.
- Or a variable rate could be specified, e.g. based on domestic interbank lending rate, possibly with a small margin deducted.
- An alternative to paying interest would be to allocate a slightly enhanced allocation rate in the first month of the offer period.
- Lengthening the offer period allows competitors more time to examine the terms of the new product, negotiate with investment banks and come to market with a rival product.
- It also increases the chance of derivative prices moving against the company, after the terms have been set and before the money is invested.

**What are the similarities between guaranteed equity product and universal life?** 
- Both pay a specified amount on death.
- Both may offer a surrender value.
- The surrender value is not guaranteed or known for either.
- Both are relatively complex product designs.
- The policyholder accepts some investment risk under both.

**What are the differences between guaranteed equity product and universal life?** 
- The main purpose of the universal life product is protection: i.e. providing a death benefit. The main purpose of the guaranteed equity product is likely to be savings, since it provides the potential for equity market exposure with downside protection.
- Universal life is similar to a whole life assurance rather than an endowment assurance; there is no specified maturity benefit, unlike for the guaranteed equity product.
- Universal life is normally a regular (typically monthly) premium policy, whereas the guaranteed equity product is single premium.
- The policyholder can vary universal life premium amounts.
- But this is subject to any minimum and maximum amounts specified in the policy. 
- Under universal life, the policyholder may be able to vary the death benefit amount. 
- Although any increase in death benefit could be subject to insurability.
- The surrender value for the guaranteed equity bond is discretionary and would likely be based on the value of the underlying assets, which would not be known by the policyholder at any point in time.
- The surrender value for the universal life product is the value of the cash account which is built up from the excess of premiums over the cost of providing death cover and expense charges, plus interest. The policyholder would be able to monitor this amount each month.
- The cash value for the universal life product can fall to zero, at which point the policy might automatically lapse.
- The growth in value for the guaranteed equity bond depends on the performance of the domestic stock market index. The growth in value of the cash account for the universal life product depends on how the interest rate declared is determined. It may reflect cash returns, yields on bonds and/or equity returns, depending on the investment approach taken by the life insurance company.
- Derivatives are unlikely to be held to back the universal life product.
- The universal life product expense charges are likely to be more transparent to the policyholder than those included within the pricing for the guaranteed equity life bond.
- The guaranteed equity product is sold simultaneously in tranches, in order to manage the purchase of the underlying derivatives. The universal life product can be sold continuously. 
- There may be different tax treatments of the benefits. 
- Under the universal life product, policyholders may also have the option to take out a loan from the insurance company on which interest would be payable.
