<u><b>Q1(ii)</b></u>
**What are the key risks to unit-linked pensions and immediate annuities?**
- (Equity) market risk - unit-linked pensions and immediate annuities.
- Credit/counterparty risk - unit-linked pensions and immediate annuities.
- Persistency risk - unit-linked pensions only.
- Longevity risk - immediate annuities only.
- Expense risk - unit-linked pensions and immediate annuities.
- Operational risk - unit-linked pensions and immediate annuities.

<u><b>Q1(iii)</b></u>
**What are the correlations between the above risks?**
**Persistency and expense**
- Persistency is negatively correlated with expenses.
- As withdrawals reduce the number of polices so increases per policy expenses;
- as fixed overheads will be spread over fewer policies.
- If there are a very large number of transfers, then the expenses of administering each pension transfer might increase, e.g. overtime costs or hiring temporary staff.

**Operational and persistency**
- Severity of operational risk events is negatively correlated with persistency.
- Operational risk events result in negative publicity and so are likely to lead to increased number of policyholders transferring their funds to other providers.
- High levels of transfers could also cause operational disruptions e.g. if unable to cope with the processing.
- In addition, management may be distracted by operational problems leading to a lack of focus on the business, in turn leading to transfers.

**Longevity and credit**
- Longevity is positively correlated with credit default events.
- The reinsurers of the annuity business is more likely to default if longevity increases.
- The counterparty of a longevity swap is more likely to default if longevity increases.
- Companies which have issued debt may be more likely to default in situations where pension scheme costs of deficits have increased significantly due to longevity.

**Persistency and market**
- The number of withdrawals is positively correlated with poor stock market performance.
- Policyholders are more likely to transfer to other providers if the company's unit-linked funds perform poorly.
- If market values reduce then persistency may worsen as policyholders become nervous about maintaining their investment in volatile assets.
- However, pensions legislation may restrict full surrender.
- But paid up rates could increase at the same time as market performance is poor;
- e.g. the policyholder may lose their job during a recession and so be unable to afford the premiums.

**Credit and market**
- The number of defaults is positively correlated with poor stock market performance.
- If investment market performance is poor then we would expect companies to be experiencing financial difficulties;
- and so the risk of defaults would increase

**Expense and market**
- Expense levels are positively correlated with poor stock market performance.
- Lower market levels give lower funds on unit-linked pensions and so less assets to spread fixed investment expenses over. 

**Operational and expense**
- The severity of operational risk events is positively correlated with expense.
- Operational risk events could generate additional costs due to need to rectify the situation.

<u><b>Q1(iv)</b></u>
**What is the purpose of the deposit back arrangement?**
- If the reinsurer were to default on its obligations;
- then the insurer would still have enough to cover 101% of the reserves.
