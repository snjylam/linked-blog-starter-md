**What are the ways government action can impact the amount of life insurance sold?**
**Taxation**
- Tax incentives could be offered to policyholders or life insurance companies.
- e.g. tax relief on premiums paid by the policyholder.
- e.g. tax relief on premiums paid by the employer.
- e.g. tax relief on investment income and capital gains earned within the life insurance product.
- e.g. tax free gains on life insurance product benefits.
- Other types of financial products can be taxed less advantageously to encourage take up of life insurance.
- Tax incentives can be applied across all business or only for certain products (e.g. those with a material level of life cover).
- Products may be designed to mitigate tax payments, e.g. inheritance tax.

**Legislation - capital requirements**
- If legislation is onerous, it may reduce the amount of new business written.
- For example, high capital requirements can restrict the amount of new business that can be written.
- The cost of compliance with legislation may be passed to customers through pricing, increasing premiums and reducing volumes sold.

**Legislation - consumer protection**
- Stringent consumer protection legislation, in relation to poor selling practices, might reduce new business written in the short term due to fewer policies that do not meet customer needs.
- But in the long run, would increase consumer confidence in the market and hence increase the attractiveness of insurance products.
- The same applies to legislation relating to distribution channels and methods.

**Legislation - product design**
- The government might ban the sale of certain types of products.
- Or it may impose mandatory requirements on the purchase of some life insurance products.
- e.g. mandatory employer provision of a minimum level of pension benefits to employees.
- The government may impose caps on charges and/or exit penalties.
- These may make insurance products more attractive to customers.
- But could make them unprofitable for providers and hence companies may choose not to market them.
- Changes to regulation on how retirement benefits can be taken world impact new business volumes for certain product types.
- For example, the removal of mandatory requirement to purchase an annuity at retirement would reduce the volume of immediate annuity sales.
- But may increase the volumes of other retirement products sold such as income drawdown.

**Legislation - market conduct**
- Legislation may be a barrier to new entrants into the insurance market. 
- Particularly companies that are based in other countries.
- There may be regulation in place relating to ESG considerations or climate change.
- Which could potentially increase the attractiveness of life insurance products that offer sustainable investment options.
- Legislation impacting the factors by which premiums can be differentiated can impact the amount of life insurance business sold.
- e.g. removal of the ability to price by gender could result in fewer of the lower risk gender continuing to purchase that product.
- If a government imposes fines on an insurance company, this can damage its reputation and reduce its ability to sell new business.

**Legislation - competition**
- Competition legislation can impact the number of insurance providers operating in the market and hence potentially the amount of business sold.
- The relative level of legislation and regulatory constraints imposed on other financial product providers (e.g. banks, investment)  will influence the relative attractiveness of insurance products.
- Government may permit companies other than traditional financial services providers to sell life insurance business (e.g. supermarkets), which could broaden the potential for selling products.

**Economic**
- Government actions can influence the confidence in the economy.
- e.g. instability or weakness of a government.
- e.g. changes in government policy.
- e.g. changes in governing party.
- The government may have influence over monetary policy, including short-term interest rates.
- This will impact economic growth.
- Thus the propensity to purchase insurance products.
- In particular, insurance-linked products may be attractive in periods of high economic growth.
- Whereas in times of economic uncertainty, products with high guarantees may be more attractive.
- However, the cost of such guarantees may be prohibitive, thus reducing potential for higher sales.
- Low interest rates will result in lower projected benefits on sales illustrations , resulting in fewer sales.
- If a government introduces trade tariffs with a certain country, this can have knock on effect for the economy of that country and thus the ability of customers in that country to afford life insurance.

**Other actions**
- The government could undertake educational exercises to improve customer's understanding of the importance of purchasing life insurance products.
- A government could provide incentives to purchase insurance products to its population.
- e.g. microinsurance in developing countries.
- Government policies in relation to data/cyber security can influence the extent to which insurance companies can utilize information and technology, and thus the ease with which attractive and cheap products can be brought to market.
- The provision of financial benefits by the State will influence the extent to which private provision is necessary.
- The extent to which the State provides free healthcare services will influence the sales of health-related insurance products (e.g. critical illness policies, long-term care annuities).
