**What unfair contract terms could apply to equity release lifetime mortgage?**
- The wording may not be easily understood.
- Particularly by vulnerable customers.
- For example, a repayment amount may still be due under the loan after the house has been sold may not be understood.
- The terms under which the contract can be cancelled may not be clearly defined.
- There may be a very high penalty imposed on early repayment of the loan.
- There may be disproportionately high charges imposed on the sale of the property (e.g. relating to valuation and selling costs).
- The way in which charges are taken may not be clearly defined or explained.
- There may be no clear definition of what triggers the repayment of the loan, e.g. what is long-term care.
- There may be no clear explanation of the rights of dependents who are living in the property at the time of death or transfer to long-term care of the named mortgage holder.
- There may be no clear explanation whether mortgages can be transferred between single and joint lives.
- There may be no clear explanation how the mortgage could be transferred onto a new home, if the individual decides to move house.
- There may be no clear explanation of any drawdown facilities, under which future loans can be taken out.
- There may be no clear explanation of how variable interest rate is set.
- The company may have too much discretion over the interest rate charged, and could in theory increase it without limit after the contract has been agreed.
- The company may be able to change the characteristics of the service provided after the customer has been bound by the contract.
- e.g. requiring certain standards of property maintenance which were not explained at outset.

**What key risks do individual or their estate face when entering into equity release lifetime mortgage?**
- The main risk is that the value of the house at time of sale is lower than the amount to be repaid.
- The individual or their estate will have to make up this shortfall.
- The key drivers of this risk are higher than expected interest rates;
- and/or low property growth rates or property market crashes.
- These drivers are likely correlated which exacerbates this risk.
- There is a risk the insurance company will push for a quick sale, in order to obtain the repayment amount, and consequently achieve a much lower price than otherwise.
- There is a risk the individual will be unable to maintain the house in condition required by insurance company.
- Or that the expense of doing so increases materially.
- There is a risk the product could have adverse impact on individual's tax position, including inheritance tax;
- and/or their eligibility for State benefits.
- Particularly if there are changes to legislation in these areas.
- Even if the contract terms are fair, there is a risk the individual has not understood them correctly.
- There is a risk the product has been mis-sold to them and it doesn't meet their needs.
- Even if the charges are fair, there is a risk that they are higher than the individual expected.

**What impact does gender have on equity release lifetime mortgage?**
- The main impact gender will have on experience is related to mortality and long-term care inception rates.
- On average, females are likely to live longer in old age and without going into long-term care than males.
- Hence the period over which the mortgage is in-force will on average be longer for females.
- The insurance company is likely to be taking a profit margin in the interest rate charged.
- Hence the longer the period over which the mortgage is in-force, the higher the profits achieved by the company.
- However, the longer the period in-force, the more chance there is that property prices will crash and that the sale proceeds will not meet the loan repayment.
- This will only impact the insurance company to the extent that the individual’s estate is unable to make up the shortfall.
- Males and females might also have different propensity to repay early, increasing or reducing the above effects.
- Overall, however, it is likely that the company will be making a higher profit on lifetime mortgages taken out by females.

<u><b>X1.3(iv)</b></u>
**What impact does equality legislation have on equity release lifetime mortgage?**
- If different individuals generate different levels of profit, there is new business mix risk.
- Assuming that females generate higher profits on average than males, then if the company sells a higher proportion of its mortgages to males than expected it will make lower profits overall. 
- It may be difficult to estimate the gender mix when the product is first being priced. 
- However, the company will gain experience over time.
- There may also be industry data on which to base the gender mix assumption.
- The method of marketing could be targeted towards females in order to support the gender balance, e.g. by advertising in gender-biased publications.
- However, the opportunity to do this may be restricted if it would be seen as being indirect discrimination.
- Charging the same interest rate to everyone has practical advantages such as simpler systems. 
- There may also be reputational risk and greater exposure to complaints if different interest rates were allowed and were charged.
