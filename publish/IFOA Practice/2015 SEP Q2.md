<u><b>Q2(ii)</b></u>
**What are the risks the company is exposed to by outsourcing?**
**Administrative errors**
- There is risk the staff administering the business are not sufficiently skilled;
- particularly in understanding the products.
- Therefore more mistakes could be made resulting in fall in service standards;
- leading to unhappy customers and complaints.

**Conduct**
- There is a risk the customer service availability may not be as effective or extensive than at present.
- The risk is increased if customers have contact with the outsourcing staff only.
- Because interaction with customers is through the outsourcer, there is a risk of the outsourcer not treating customers fairly.
- There may be significant redundancies of current staff, or transfer of current staff to the outsourcer.
- This may lead to local and national reputational damage.

**Data**
- Data will need to be transferred from the company's IT systems to the outsourcer's IT systems, which will expose the company to the risk of errors or delays in transfer.
- This may increase costs and reduce service standards. 
- There is risk of the systems being incompatible with each other (e.g. Financial with Actuarial Valuation systems)
 
 **Poor standards of policy service - reducing new business**
 - There will be a delay in system developments on the current system, which may put future new business or product developments at risk.
- Poor service may lead to reduction in future new business and withdrawals;
- particularly for group pension products where administration services are critical.
- The lower levels of new business and increased withdrawals may lead to risk of not meeting overhead expenses.
- There is risk that management's focus is directed away from generating new business as they may be preoccupied in dealing with the outsourcing arrangements and any problems that may arise.
- As a result of negative reputational impact, there is further risk of increased withdrawals.

**Unit pricing**
- The company will be exposed to the risk of lack of controls in the outsourcer's unit pricing function.
- This could lead to significant risk of providing compensation for any unit pricing errors;
- and additional costs in rectifying client records.
- Any unit pricing error would increase risk of regulatory intervention.

 **Counterparty risk**
- There is a risk the outsourcer does not fulfil its contractual obligations in a timely manner.
- In the extreme, the outsourcer could default and walk away.
- There is the risk that if required, the company would not be able to bring back the administration in-house sufficiently quickly, leading to business disruption;
- or a risk that it would not be able to find another outsourcing company quickly enough and at an acceptable price.

**Legal risk**
- The outsourcing contract will introduce legal risk.
- The contract will be for a specific period and likely have a schedule of changes to be made.
- The company will be exposed to uncertainties that arise at the end of the contract; with the potential need for in-sourcing or alternative outsourcing.
