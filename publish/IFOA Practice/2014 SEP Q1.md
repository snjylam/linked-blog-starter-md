<u><b>Q1(i)</b></u>
**What are asset shares used for in a with-profits fund?**
**Treating customers fairly**
- Policy asset shares are widely used in with-profits companies as a benchmark for determining the level of payouts to with-profits policyholders and as an input to the consideration and quantification of any requirement to treat customers fairly.
- Asset shares may be used as a guide to what constitutes a fair payout, but a payout different to asset share isn't necessarily unfair.
- The definition and the way the company uses asset shares must be consistent with the description in its customer-facing literature (such as the PPFM in the UK).

**Maturity payouts and terminal bonus**
- Most companies using the 'addition to benefits' method use asset shares as a guide for determining maturity values.
- Terminal bonus can be calculated using asset shares for the maturing cohort;
- the asset shares are then compared to the contractual benefits of the cohort;
- terminal bonus is based on the excess of the asset shares over contractual benefits;
- subject to the company's smoothing policy.
- Policy asset shares are also used by most companies to help the smoothing process for maturity values.
- The smoothing profit / loss can be calculated each year as the excess of the asset share over the actual payouts to policyholders.
- An alternative to calculating payouts using asset shares for a maturing cohort is to consider a typical example policy.
- Maturity payouts may be based on a smoothed asset share.
- Firms may specify target ranges around 100% of asset share within which 90% of maturity payouts must lie.
- Monitoring the profits and losses from smoothing each year can help companies ensure that it pays out an average asset share over time.
- This ensures smoothed payouts are fair overall.
