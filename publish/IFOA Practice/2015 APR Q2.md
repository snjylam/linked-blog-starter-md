<u><b>Q2(i)</b></u>
**What is the appropriateness of not including VIF element in EV under Solvency II?**
**Reasons why ignoring the VIF is appropriate**
- The Solvency II rules require BEL to be calculated on best estimate assumptions.
- Therefore, there are no margins in the mortality or expense assumptions to be release into profit.
- The investment return assumption used in the MCEV and the discount rate assumption used under Solvency II are both based on risk-free rates.
- This suggests that there would also be no profit arising on investment experience.
- It would be double counting to add the VIF to the embedded value;
- as the VIF has already been deducted from the liabilities by the use of best estimate assumptions.
- So it is appropriate that there is no present value of future profits;
- in respect of mortality and expenses.
- It is appropriate that there is no VIF in respect of investment return also (as MCEV and Solvency II both use a risk-free rate as described above).

**Reasons why ignoring the VIF is not appropriate**
- However, under Solvency II the company may be making use of either the matching adjustment;
- or volatility adjustment.
- Under the MCEV a 'liquidity premium' may be added to the risk-free rate.
- If the impact of the matching / volatility adjustment under Solvency II is the same as the liquidity premium under MCEV, then there will be no emergence of future profit (or losses).
- However, if the impact is not the same it would be appropriate to ignore VIF in the calculation.
- Any difference between the matching / volatility adjustment will lead to small profits (or losses) emerging overtime which should have been included in the EV calculation.
- Future profits can only be taken credit for up to any contract boundaries under Solvency II.
- So the company might wish to hold an element of VIF in relation to future profits arising beyond such boundaries, if they apply - although this will not be the case for the immediate annuities mentioned.
- The release of the risk margin could be considered an element of VIF (and this is already allowed for in the MCEV by including the risk margin less the cost of holding it).

<u><b>Q2(ii)</b></u>
**What is the items included in analysis of change in EV?**
- Embedded value at start of year.
- Opening adjustments, e.g. model changes.
- Return on net assets.
- Expected return on in-force business.
- Non-economic experience variances.
- Non-economic assumption variances.
- Economic experience variances.
- Economic assumption variances.
- New business contribution.
- Exceptional expenses.
- Tax variances.
- Capital injections.
- Capital distributed / dividends paid out.
- Unexplained.
- Embedded value at end of year.

<u><b>Q2(iii)</b></u>
**How to analyse change in MCEV due to differences between assumptions and experience?**
- One method that could be used to analyse experience variances would be the projection approach.
- Assets are allocated to the contracts equal to the value of the BEL at beginning of the year.
- The assets and BEL are projected forward to the end of the year;
- using the beginning of the year BEL assumptions as the expected experience over the year.
- The profit emerging during the year is the difference between year-end assets and BEL.
- For first step (i.e. all experience items taken their expected value) the profit emerging will be zero.
- Repeat the above projection of assets, liabilities and profit, changing one of the items of the experience from the expected value to the actual value;
- The difference in the profit (or surplus) arising under the runs give the contribution from that item of experience
- Repeat for each item of experience.
- The results depend on the order in which the items are considered.
- So, maintaining consistency year on year is important.
- It may not be possible to get an accurate figure using this approach for items such as mortality or lapses, as the modelled expected would apply an average rate to all policies whereas the actual may, for example, be concentrated around large policies or may be a different shape to the table used.
- In this case, the variance may be derived from analysing a file of data movements.
