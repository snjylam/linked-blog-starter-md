<u><b>Q2(i)</b></u>
**What is the appropriateness of not including VIF element in EV under Solvency II?**
**Reasons why ignoring the VIF is appropriate**
- The Solvency II rules require BEL to be calculated on best estimate assumptions.
- Therefore, there are no margins in the mortality or expense assumptions to be release into profit.
- The investment return assumption used in the MCEV and the discount rate assumption used under Solvency II are both based on risk-free rates.
- This suggests that there would also be no profit arising on investment experience.
- It would be double counting to add the VIF to the embedded value;
- as the VIF has already been deducted from the liabilities by the use of best estimate assumptions.
- So it is appropriate that there is no present value of future profits;
- in respect of mortality and expenses.
- It is appropriate that there is no VIF in respect of investment return also (as MCEV and Solvency II both use a risk-free rate as described above).

**Reasons why ignoring the VIF is not appropriate**
- However, under Solvency II the company may be making use of either the matching adjustment;
- or volatility adjustment.
- Under the MCEV a 'liquidity premium' may be added to the risk-free rate.
- If the impact of the matching / volatility adjustment under Solvency II is the same as the liquidity premium under MCEV, then there will be no emergence of future profit (or losses).
- However, if the impact is not the same it would be appropriate to ignore VIF in the calculation.
- Any difference between the matching / volatility adjustment will lead to small profits (or losses) emerging overtime which should have been included in the EV calculation.
- Future profits can only be taken credit for up to any contract boundaries under Solvency II.
- So the company might wish to hold an element of VIF in relation to future profits arising beyond such boundaries, if they apply - although this will not be the case for the immediate annuities mentioned.
- The release of the risk margin could be considered an element of VIF (and this is already allowed for in the MCEV by including the risk margin less the cost of holding it).
